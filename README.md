Student Manager System (Java)

Project Overview
-The Student Manager System is a beginner Java desktop application built using JOptionPane for GUI interaction.
-This program allows users to:

-Add new students
-Display all students
-Identify the student with the highest marks
-Search for a student using their student number
-The system uses parallel arrays to store and manage student data.

Technologies Used
-Java
-JOptionPane (Swing)
-Arrays
-Control Structures (Loops, Switch Statements)
-Basic Searching & Comparison Algorithms


Key Concepts Demonstrated
-Use of static global arrays
-Data storage using parallel arrays
-Input validation structure
-Loop-based menu system
-Linear search algorithm
-Maximum value comparison algorithm
-Basic GUI interaction using JOptionPane

 System Features
1. Add Student

Allows the user to input:
First Name
Last Name
Age
Marks
Student Number
Stores the information in arrays.

2. Display All Students
Displays all stored student records in formatted output.

3️. Display Student with Highest Marks
Loops through the marks array and identifies the highest scoring student.

4️. Search Student by Student Number
Implements a linear search to locate a student by their unique student number.


Data Structure Used
-The system uses parallel arrays:
-String[] firstNames
-String[] lastNames
-int[] ages
-int[] marks
-String[] studentNumbers
-Maximum capacity: 100 students


How to Run
Open the project in NetBeans 
Compile and run Student_Arrays.java.
